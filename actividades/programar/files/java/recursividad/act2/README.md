# Create a static main method that tests the following: 

• A double variable named “d”. 

• Check if the argument list contains any values, and assign the value of argument zero to the local double variable. If the argument list is empty assign a value of 5. 

• Print the factorial value and the original input value. 

• While formatting may differ, this is the expected output:
 Factorial [120.0] of [5.0]
