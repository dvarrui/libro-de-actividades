# Create a class to define and test linear recursion. Name the class Linear. Implement the following:

• A public class named “Linear”. 
• A pubic static method named “factorial” that takes a double and returns a double. 
• The base case should check whether the input value is less than or equal to 1.  (x<=1 == !x>1 == x<2)
• The recursive case should return the input value multiplied against the result of a recursive call to the factorial method with the input value minus 1.
