1) Using the following classes:

public class Title {
	String lang;
	String title;
}

public class Book {
	String category;
	Title title;
	String author;
	int year;
	float price;
}

a) Make the getters and setters,  empty constructors and full one and it toString method()

b) Make a programe that makes the deserialization from book1.xml using the previous classes
	-You gotta make 3 programs in total.
	1. Parsing the xml with DOM  
	2. Parsing the xml with SAX
	3. Parsing the xml wity StAX
		

*To verify it works, show up for each program the output by console.
